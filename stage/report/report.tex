\section*{ Introduction }
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

	Filters are nowadays essential tools for designing responsive systems.
	As they appear in both signal processing and command communities,
	we can see that the use of filters is now spreading in many domains, related to them,
	such as radio signal coding and decoding, image and sound processing, and so on.


	Although most of all the potential filters can be computed in software,
	some interesting applications in hardware could help to accelerate such computations, 
	that might be very long in software in particular cases.
	Moreover, it allows to design and reconfigure specific parts of the hardware when working with FPGAs.

	
	My work at the CITI lab in the SOCRATE team was to design a parametric architecture generator for LTI filters, 
	which will be very useful to design a software-defined radio.
	This work has been integrated to FloPoCo tool,
	whose main goal is to generate architecture cores for computing just right.


	In this report, I will first present reminders about signal processing.
	Then I will tell a little more about LTI filters and their software implementation in finite precision.
	Finally, I will present the main aspects of the hardware implementation of such filters.

\section{Motivations}
	The main motivation of this work is to be able to compute efficiently LTI Filters in hardware.
	A more precise problem is the loopback problem, that is, when a filter uses its own outputs as inputs.
	Indeed, as the output is infinite, the problems of precision induce infinitely amplified errors,
	which cause the result to be unusable.
	In this case, the solution retained in the industry is for now to unroll such loops,
	building a very heavy hardware and wasting logic.
	The purpose of this work is to be able to build a hardware computing just right,
	avoiding logic waste.

\section*{Conclusion}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}
	In this work, I tried to give an overview of LTI filters, and the considerations to take into account when trying to implement them.
	I tried to adapt concepts and computations from Lopez's and Hilaire's work to the context of generating architectures computing just right.
	This context is merging ideas from the communities of automatic, signal, and computer arithmetics.
	Finally, I began the implementation of a parametric definition in the FloPoCo framework.
	This was permitted through the definition of a specification language and the comibination of the FloPoCo operators.
