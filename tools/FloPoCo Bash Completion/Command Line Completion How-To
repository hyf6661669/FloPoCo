Command completion for FloPoCo How-To

1) How do I use the command completion feature?
	Easy. Just start typying and when you don't know how to complete the rest press [TAB].
	
2) What do I need to do to get it working?
	Step 1: Enable the command line completion feature, if it's not already enabled. You can do that by
			un-commenting the following lines in you .bashrc file (NOTE: the comments before need to remain commented-out):
				# enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
				# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile
				# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
				if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then
				    . /etc/bash_completion
				fi
	Step 2: If the file 'flopoco' (which should be in this directory also) is not already coppied to /etc/bash_completion.d , then you should do it
	
3) What else id there to do?
	If you make your own operators and want to have completions for them, then you should 
	probably add then to the 'flopoco' file that is coppied to /etc/bash_completion.d, in the
	appropriate places.
