The intent of the authors is to distribute FloPoCo as free software (in the FSF AGPL sense), while imposing that the source code generated by FloPoCo is also free software (also AGPL-like). 

The build procedure is shown in the installation guide that you can find in doc/web/flopoco_installation.html
