* Stable stuff:


** FixFunction
    Centralizes Sollya parsing and evaluation to various formats, including an emulate() that works for all FixFunctionBy*

** FixFunctionByTable: a flopoco operator that is the most basic implementation of a FixFunction

** BasicPolyApprox: mostly Sollya stuff to compute optimal coeff sizes, the machine-efficient polynomials.
	 Important attributes can then be accessed by other classes as
		int getDegree();
		double getApproxErrorBound();
		FixConstant* getCoeff(int i);



* Stuff in progress
** FixPolyEval: generic class for polynomial evaluation
	 Mostly useless, holds various definitions and sanity checks.
	 This is an evaluator that should work for a set of polynomials, passed as a vector of BasicPolyApprox.
 
** FixHornerEval:FixPolyEval 
	 Computes for each of the polynomials the error analysis, determining internal datapath sizes. Then takes the worst case and produces VHDL

** FixParallelEval:FixPolyEval 
	 TODO some day, with a nice bit heap and optimized Y^k

** FixFunctionByPiecewisePoly

** FixFunctionBySimplePoly: should disappear (it is a special case of FixFunctionByPiecewisePoly)


TODO long term: manage non-uniform errors; manage non-uniform segmentation; something for sin(sqrt(x))




FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator: 
  constructor inputs alpha,  a table of 2^alpha vectors of coefficients, lsbY
  and builds table + horner evaluator (operator inputting index and Y)

			evaluates the corresponding polynomial(s) with truncated multipliers.
								REM a trunc mult faithful to lsb will compute weights to LSB+g 



FixFunctionBySimpleBitHeap: an Operator plugging BasicPolyApprox to a bit heap back-end.
													 (with bit heaps you don't do piecewise polynomials, or you do it the HOTBM way)


FixFunctionByPiecewisePoly:
								the flopoco operator corresponding to the previous FunctionEvaluator
								It plugs PiecewisePolyApprox to FixPolynomialHornerEvaluator
