** See UGLYHACK in IntMultiplier
** IntSquarer should be made non-xilinx-specific, and bitheapized
** Same for IntKaratsuba and FPKaratsuba, which have been disabled completely

** Sum of n squares
** LUT-based integer comparators
** BoxMuller


* Improvements to do, operator by operator
** Collision
*** manage infinities etc
*** decompose into FPSumOf3Squares and Collision

** HOTBM
*** true FloPoCoization, pipeline

ConstMult:

** ConstMult
*** group KCM and shift-and-add in a single OO hierearchy (selecting the one with less hardware)
*** For FPConstMult, don't output the LSBs of the IntConstMult 
   but only their sticky
*** more clever, Lefevre-inspired algorithm
*** Use DSP: find the most interesting constant fitting on 18 bits
*** compare with Spiral.net and Gustafsson papers
*** Implement the continued fraction stuff for FPCRConstMult

** Shifters
*** provide finer spec, see the TODOs inside Shifter.cpp

* If we could redo pipeline from scratch
If we were to redo the pipeline framework from scratch, here is the proper way to do it.

The current situation has a history: we first added cycle management, then, as a refinement, critical-path based subcycle timing.
So we have to manage explicitely the two components of a lexicographic time (cycle and delay within a cycle)
But there is only one wallclock time, and the decomposition of this wallclock time into cycles and sub-cycles could be automatic. And should.
 
The following version of declare() could remove the need for manageCriticalPath as well as all the explicit synchronization methods.
declare(name, size, delay)
declares a signal, and associates its computation delay to it.  This delay is what we currently pass to manageCriticalPath. Each signal now will have a delay associated to it (with a default of 0 for signals that do not add to the critical path).
The semantics is: this signal will not be assigned its value before the instant delta + max(instants of the RHS signals) 
This is all what the first pass, the one that populates the vhdl stream, needs to do. No explicit synchronization management needed. No need to setCycle to "come back in time", etc.

Then we have a retiming procedure that must associate a cycle to each signal. 
It will do both synchronization and cycle computation. According to Alain Darte there is an old retiming paper that shows that the retiming problem can be solved optimally in linear time for DAGs, which is not surprising.
Example of simple procedure: 
first build the DAG of signals (all it takes is the same RHS parsing, looking for signal names, as we do)
Then sit on the existing scheduling literature...
For instance  
1/ build the operator's critical path
2/ build the ASAP and ALAP instants for each signal
3/ progress from output to input, allocating a cycle to each signal, with ALAP scheduling (should minimize register count for compressing operators)
4/ possibly do a bit of Leiserson and Saxe retiming 

We keep all the current advantages: 
- still VHDL printing based
- When developing an operator, we initially leave all the deltas to zero to debug the combinatorial version. Then we incrementally add deltas, just like we currently  add manageCriticalPath(). 
- etc

The difference is that the semantic is now much clearer. No more notion of a block following a manageCriticalPath(), etc

The question is: don't we loose some control on the circuit with this approach, compared to what we currently do?

Note that all this is so much closer to textbook literature, with simple DAGs labelled by delay...

* If we could redo the CLI from scratch
Big problem with current implementation:
 The CLI arguments and online help are not defined within the class of the operator, but in main.cpp
 The HTML user documentation is yet another document, which is not auto-generated

Proposal (WIP):
CLI is changed so that 
flopoco FPExp 8 23  FPAdd 8 23 FPAdd 11 52 
becomes 
flopoco --io=float:8:23 FPExp FPAdd --io=float:11:52 FPAdd
All options affect the following operators (just like current -pipeline )

The constructor of any operator takes only a Target, and a parameter map (key, value) where both key and value are strings 
There is a default map (including the default target etc)
All main.cpp does is parse the command line to build the parameter map (possibly overriding default) before calling each constructor in turn.

An Operator, e.g. FPExp defines another static possibleParametersMap (key, (type, default value, help string)).
It may inherit the default Operator map, and add any key it needs for FPExp-specific parameters, for example the k currnently passed to FPExpert.
 
The FPExp constructor does the match between its specification map (built by main) and its possibleParametersMap, and sets all the required attribute from there (including defaults)

Hopefully a static method, or a # trick,  that is used to parse the generate the help for this operator.

All main does is register all the Operators in some list, autogenerate the html manual, and prepares the parser loop. This is the part that is tricky in C++.
Maybe it should be done in Python.
